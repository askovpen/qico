TODO for v0.58 release
----------------------


- Update LICENSES file by adding the other authors and contributors,
since that is where the Copyright years are actually mentioned. (Only
two of the people otherwise mentioned are listed there.) Include
adding myself (2013, at least.)  Already noted in the README?

- stuff/test.pl:
    - Change '$Id" line for mitry to copyright line
    - Add copyright line for me (2013)


- Will need to either update src/cvsdate.h or remove it before creating
an archive (is it actually used during a build?) (do a test build
without it? check makefile.in files?)

- In at least the shell & bash scripts: for those that have the cvs
info lines (all of them?), they're always associated with user id
and day, so change them to to Copyright lines, and also add a line
for me. If they do not otherwise have some kind of license information,
use some kind of short form of the overall gico license. 

- ChangeLog: change from using just user name to full email address,
or make a cross reference note of that info perhaps at the top of 
the file. (Like already present in, for instance, the README file.)

- ChangeLog: change tabs to just spaces.

- The "src/cvsdate.h" file is left over from when primarily using the 
cvs repository.  It is still useful to have something like that
but find another way to do the updates for it besides manually?
Match it to the most recent entry in ChangeLog? It contains a timestamp
consisting of date and time.

- stuff/ftn: should really be renamed as stuff/qico as it only does 
stop/start etc for qico and not any other FTN services.  ("FTN" is too
generic.)  Do as part of otherwise updating the file? Like changing
the "$ID" line (7) to be a copyright line.  (It's old & so may not
still be valid on current Redhat systems.)  The author doesn't 
otherwise note the license, so just use the qico one.

- Convert overall build system to CMake.

- configure:  since this is generated from configure.in, why is it in the code
repository?

- That 'cvs.todes.by' doesn't seem to be a valid domain name any longer.
README:      cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.todes.by:/cvsroot co qicoxe
README:      cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.todes.by:/cvsroot co -r xe-0_57-r1 qicoxe
-> Remove altogether, since the code for it is now included in the main 
branch at the xe archives are also available for download?

- Rename the 'man' directory as 'doc' and use it for all documentation and
example files.  Move that type of file from 'stuff' directory to 'doc'. For
the example shell & perl scripts, use a 'doc/examples' directory instead of
the existing 'stuff' directory?
